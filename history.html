            <h1>The history of Morse Code And Female Spies</h1>
            <h2>The history of morse code</h2>
            <p>In 1844, Samuel F.B. Morse created morse code as the first real signal communication.</p>
            <p>According to Brittanica, “Despite the early pioneering efforts on land and sea the real development of signal communication in war did not come until after invention of the electric telegraph by Samuel F.B. Morse. In his successful demonstration of electric communication between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore in 1844, he provided a completely new means of rapid signal communication.”</p>

            <h2>Female Spies</h2>
            <p>During the civil war, while the men were fighting, the Women had other things to do. One of those was becoming a spy. Women would do multiple things, like dressing up as men so that they could fight in the war.</p>
            <p>According to Gale, ”One of the more successful was Union spy Elizabeth Van Lew (1818–1900), of Richmond, Virginia . Van Lew pretended to be eccentric (odd) so that Confederate officials would consider her crazy but not dangerous. She helped prisoners escape from Richmond and gave General Ulysses S. Grant (1822–1885) information that helped him capture the Confederate capital city.”.</p>
